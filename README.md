## Introduction
### What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?  Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

As E-commerce becomes more and more popular in recent years, especially by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many retailers and companies are switching their business models to adapt to the trend. In addition, with the rapid growth of big data technology, the cost of storage capacity to store enormous amounts of data from customers and visitors on the E-commerce sites decreases gradually. No matter the tech giant or start-up, all companies can make use of the gathered data to boost their business success to the next level.

In order to better understand the customers' behavior and enhance their shopping experience, product recommender systems can provide the ability to predict whether a specific customer would prefer a product by utilizing the enormous amounts of collected data and different machine learning approaches. There are several benefits that businesses can achieve using product recommender systems. 

### What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
* What characteristics are useful to generate personalized recommendations? 
* Which recommender systems algorithms/methods are most successful and practical?
* Can text data improve recommender systems' performance?
