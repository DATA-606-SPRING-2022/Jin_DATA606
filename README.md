## Introduction

As E-commerce becomes more and more popular in recent years, especially by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many retailers and companies are switching their business models to adapt to the trend. In addition, with the rapid growth of big data technology, the cost of storage capacity to store enormous amounts of data from customers and visitors on the E-commerce sites decreases gradually. No matter the tech giant or start-up, all companies can make use of the gathered data to boost their business success to the next level.

In order to better understand the customers' behavior and enhance their shopping experience, product recommender systems can provide the ability to predict whether a specific customer would prefer a product by utilizing the enormous amounts of collected data and different machine learning approaches. There are several benefits that businesses can achieve using product recommender systems. It can drive traffic through personalized email messages to the store site and increase average order value. It also enhances the shopping experience by delivering relevant content based on personalized preferences. It can reduce workload for inventory management and boost work effectiveness. Moreover, it can create comprehensive reports to support making the right decision for business direction. Overall, product recommender systems not only boost the companiesâ€™ revenue but also increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

The objective of this project is to analyze the reason for a product to be recommended and explore different data science methods and algorithms to implement product recommender systems. It will provide business owners or start-up companies a better idea of how recommender systems work and the related advantages.


## Data

The data for this project is the Amazon Review Data (2018) which is collected by the University of California San Diego (https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). The dataset includes reviews (rating, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features). It contains a total number of 233.1 million real reviews with the size of 34 gigabytes from Amazon. I would use a subset of this data due to the computing resource limitation. The smaller dataset is the subset of the data in a specific domain/category.

## EDA

For this project, I choose the Appliance category from the entire Amazon review dataset because it has a moderate number of review and product records. There are a total of 602,777 review records in this category, and the dataset has 12 different features.

The rating distribution graphs show that the overall ratings in this review data set are highly imbalanced, which contains more than 69% of 5 stars rating.

Thus, in the following model development, we need to keep in mind that the accuracy metric may not be useful for evaluating the machine learning models; instead, precision, recall, and F1 score values could be suitable for model evaluation.
